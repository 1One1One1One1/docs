# About Replit

We have a "Deploy to Replit" button for those people that like Replit ( Railway better ). We do not recommend using Replit.

## Why is Replit bad for proxies?

- They do not allow unblockers on their site
- You can get banned if you choose to host a unblocker anyway
- It is SLOW
- Deployment takes a while
- Railway is faster and also way better

You are probably better off going <a onClick={() => window.history.back()}>back</a> and deploying this elsewhere.

Or, watch this video that may or may not help you:

## The Deploy Button

By clicking the below button, I Acknowledge that I have read and understood the above text.
<BrowserOnly>{() => (
  <a onClick={() => {
    const repo = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('repo');
    if(!repo) return alert('ERR! Something is wrong with your URL!');
    window.location = `https://repl.it/github/amethystnetwork-dev/${repo}`
  }}>
    <img height="30px" src="https://amethystnetwork-dev.github.io/assets/replit.svg" />
  </a>
)}</BrowserOnly>
